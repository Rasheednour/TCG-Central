# TLDR
basic `npm init` and `npm start` should be enough to run this locally, though we may not have added local firebase setup yet (dunno if I will remember to update this readme when I do add that).

the "deploy.sh" script can be run from this directory in the google cloud terminal to make a fresh deployment.  I've been using us-west2.
